Mathematics Core Concepts
1. Calculus: Limits, derivatives, and integrals. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus links differentiation and integration.
2. Linear Algebra: Matrix operations, eigenvalues, and vectors. Systems of linear equations can be solved using Gaussian elimination.
3. Probability: The likelihood of an event. Bayes' Theorem relates conditional probabilities of two events.
4. Statistics: Normal distribution, standard deviation, and p-values. Hypothesis testing is used to make inferences about populations.
